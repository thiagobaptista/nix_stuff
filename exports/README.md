# exports.sh

A script to centerlize all your enviromnent and path variables in a single place, instead of pulverizing the export commands all over your .bashrc or .bash_profile files.

## Usage

Put the following line at the end of your shell enviromnet settings file (.bashrc or .bash_profile):

```sh
source /path/to/file/exports.sh
```

I strongly suggest that you place this file at the root of your home directory.
